# nanotheme

this is a reddit theme for /r/nanocurrency
main obj was to make a theme that could display "realtime" info for a coin also i tried to make it look a bit like nanos website.
The "realtime" data is from cmc and is posted to the subs description/sidebar via the reddit api every min or so. Check out an example server i made to post this data (wasn't sure what i was doing so don't use mine for "production") https://github.com/GREEB/nanotheme-server


##todo

* Finish main content style
* Finish main icons for expanables
* Make icons for the rest (right nav)
* Make the coin ticker a bit better (maybe show all the info vol,btc price etc on hover in a nice "window")
* Style sidebar
* Less whitespace??
* Maybe do something cool with the social icons
* Maybe do something cool with the footer
* ....
